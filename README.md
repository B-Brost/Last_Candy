# Last_Candy

This program is a two-player game where players take turns removing candy from boxes. Player 1 chooses how many boxes they would like and player 2 chooses how many candies go in each box. Players alternate taking as many candy they would like out of the box until the last piece is taken. The player who takes the last candy wins the game.
